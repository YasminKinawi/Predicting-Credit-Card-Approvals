# Predicting Credit Card Approvals

Credit card acceptance is a critical stage for commercial banks when offering loans. A person's creditworthiness is determined by several factors when applying for a credit card, including their credit score, income, employment status, and debt-to-income ratio. The information provided is utilised by the bank in deciding whether or not to grant the credit card application.\
In the past, credit card applications had to be manually reviewed by bank staff, which took a considerable amount of time. Machine learning has made it possible to automate this task, making it easier and faster for financial institutions to approve credit card applications.

We'll use the [Credit Card Approval dataset](https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/dataset/27/credit+approval) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.\
To ensure the confidentiality of the data, the values in the dataset have been replaced by random symbols. Because we are not using this data to create actual credit screening criteria, this will still serve our needs as an example dataset.
